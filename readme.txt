A readme.txt of (3) paragraphs describing:
• Overview of what you did (i.e. what are the controls? Why this design?)
for this assignment I was inspired by a joy room/ farm but one that doesn't quite make sense, just for a little fun.
the chicken creates a cow, while barking. The cow sneezes as it disapperrs, and the egg sizzles as it grows. 
Everything is controlled by clicking.
The camera moves through arrow/wasd keys.

• What was challenging.
Getting the sound to work for the egg was a little bit of a stuggle since somethings worked, 
but when I removed an attribute that i thought was irrevelent it would break. 
Eventually going through eveything I managed to make it work. Also getting the egg to go
 back to it's size was a little bit of a struggle.

• What went well (i.e. how did you solve the above challenges?).
Getting the egg to grow was suprsingly easy, as well as having everything respond to clicks.
To solve the egg returning to it's size, I got help form a friend, and was unable to understand the concept.
